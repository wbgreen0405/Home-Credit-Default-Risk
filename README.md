## 📋 Competition Overview

*Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan?*

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/) strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience, using alternative data to predict repayment abilities.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. **Clone this repo:**  
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. **Download the competition data** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data) and place it in the `data/` folder.

3. **Install dependencies and tools:**  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Run code checks locally:**  
   - Lint: `ruff check src/`
   - Security: `bandit -r src/`
   - Tests: `pytest tests/`

5. **Run main pipeline:**  
   ```
   python src/modeling.py
   ```

6. **Explore notebooks:**  
   Open `notebooks/` in JupyterLab or VS Code.

## 🧹 Code Quality & Security

- **Logging:** All scripts use the `logging` module for traceability.
- **Linting:** [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for fast, consistent style.
- **Security:** [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) checks for common Python security issues.
- **Pre-commit:** Automated hooks for formatting, linting, and security on every commit.

## 📝 Approach & Solution

- **EDA:** [See notebooks/EDA.ipynb]
- **Features:** Aggregated statistics over application and linked datasets, with domain-inspired ratios.
- **Modeling:** LightGBM with KFold CV, tuned hyperparameters, and early stopping.
- **Validation:** Out-of-fold AUC, final Public LB ~0.792.

## 🏅 Results

- **Best Public LB Score:** 0.792
- **Final Rank:** Bronze Medal (Top 10%)

## 📊 Visualizations
